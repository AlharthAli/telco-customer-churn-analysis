# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project looks at customer churn data from a telecom company to find patterns and insights about why customers leave.

## What I Did

- Loaded the customer data from a CSV file and cleaned it up.
- Explored the data to see trends and understand which customers are more likely to churn.
- Used SQLite to run queries and dig deeper into the data.
- Created charts and visualizations using matplotlib to show the results clearly.

## Tools I Used

- Python (pandas and matplotlib libraries)
- SQLite database
- Jupyter Notebook for coding and documenting the analysis

## How to Use This

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages:  
   `pip install pandas matplotlib sqlite3`
3. Open the `churn_analysis.ipynb` notebook and run through the steps.
4. Check out the visualizations and findings.
